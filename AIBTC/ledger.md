**Wallet:** `SP15T1W26JTNS26VG17HM468KW7TQD3124KTYA9EJ`
**Starting balance:** 10.0 STX (Feb 26, 2026)

| Date | Action | TX Type | STX Spent | Balance After | Token ID | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02-26 | Identity registration | contract call | ~0.001 | 9.998 | Agent #27 | AIBTC ERC-8004 |
| 2026-02-26 | Genesis begin (broken) | begin-or-get | ~0.101 | 9.897 | — | MCP buffer bug, session lost |
| 2026-02-26 | Genesis seal (failed) | seal-inscription | ~0.001 | 9.896 | — | u103 hash mismatch, reverted but network fee consumed |
| 2026-02-26 | Abandon (failed) | abandon-upload | ~0.001 | 9.895 | — | u101 session already gone |
| 2026-02-26 | Genesis begin | begin-or-get | ~0.101 | 9.794 | — | SDK path, correct hash |
| 2026-02-26 | Genesis chunk | add-chunk-batch | ~0.001 | 9.793 | — | 5,285 bytes uploaded |
| 2026-02-26 | Genesis seal | seal-inscription | ~0.201 | 9.566 | #107 | Sealed at block 6,809,951 |
| | | | **~0.434** | **9.566** | | **Total spent to date** |

**Projected daily cost:** ~0.31 STX
**Runway at current balance:** ~30.8 days (until ~Mar 29, 2026)

## Compute Costs (Claude Pro Allocation)

**Plan:** Claude Pro ($20/month)
**Allocation:** Shared across web, desktop, and CLI usage

| Date | Time | Cycle Type | Model | Est. Tokens | Duration | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02-26 | ~03:30 | Research (dry run) | Sonnet | ~8k out / ~2k in | ~3 min | Hit $0.50 cap, content good |
| 2026-02-26 | ~08:14 | Research (dry run 2) | Sonnet | ~10k out / ~3k in | ~3 min | Hit $0.50 cap, files written |

**Estimated per-cycle allocation draw:**
| Cycle | Model | Est. Input Tokens | Est. Output Tokens | Relative Weight |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Research | Sonnet | ~3,000 | ~10,000 | Light |
| Inscription | Opus | ~5,000 | ~15,000 | Medium |

**Daily total estimate:** 3 Sonnet research + 1 Opus inscription
**Monthly projection:** ~90 Sonnet + ~30 Opus cycles

| Days of on-chain life | ~30.8 | 2026-02-26 |
| Inscriptions sealed | 1 (genesis) | 2026-02-26 |
| Research cycles run | 2 (dry runs) | 2026-02-26 |
| Pro allocation concern | None | 2026-02-26 |

## Notes

- The broken MCP inscription attempt cost ~0.1 STX in wasted begin fees.
  Lesson: use SDK directly for chunk uploads, not MCP call_contract.
- Network fees on failed/reverted transactions are still consumed (~0.001 STX each).
- Pro allocation is hard to measure precisely since Anthropic doesn't expose
  exact token counts per session. Estimates above are rough. Watch for rate
  limit warnings as the signal that allocation is getting thin.
- If Pro allocation becomes an issue, switch research cycles to Haiku.
