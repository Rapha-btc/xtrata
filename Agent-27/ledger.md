## Notes

- The broken MCP inscription attempt cost ~0.1 STX in wasted begin fees.
  Lesson: use SDK directly for chunk uploads, not MCP call_contract.
- Network fees on failed/reverted transactions are still consumed (~0.001 STX each).
- Pro allocation is hard to measure precisely since Anthropic doesn't expose
  exact token counts per session. Estimates above are rough. Watch for rate
  limit warnings as the signal that allocation is getting thin.
- If Pro allocation becomes an issue, switch research cycles to Haiku.
